### 👥 User Roles
There are two user roles:
1. **Admin**
2. **Student**

---

### 🔐 Login System
- Dual-tab login interface (Admin / Student)
- Clean and modern UI with validation
- **For Students:**
  - Login ID = Roll Number  
  - Password = Student Name (case-insensitive)
  - Invalid Roll Number → show “Invalid Username”
  - Invalid Password → show “Incorrect Password”
- **For Admins:**
  - Login ID = Admin Name  
  - Password = `KNSGP2023`
  - Invalid Username or Password should show proper error
- Protect all admin routes & pages with session/JWT authentication

### 👨‍💼 Admin Details
Admins:
- Md Kashif  
- Md Shad  
- Rajesh Ranjan  
- Deepak Kumar  
- Rajan Kumar  

All share password: **KNSGP2023**

### 👨‍🎓 Student Data
Use a sample student list (or empty table initially) that can be managed by admin.  
Admin should have the ability to **add, edit, or delete** any student record.
