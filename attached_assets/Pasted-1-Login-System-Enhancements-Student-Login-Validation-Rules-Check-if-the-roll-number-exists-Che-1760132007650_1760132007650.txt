1. Login System Enhancements
Student Login

Validation Rules:

Check if the roll number exists.

Check if the password (student name) matches.

Show “Invalid Username” if roll number not found.

Show “Invalid Password” if password does not match.

Make student name password case-insensitive.

Admin Login

Check if admin username exists.

Check if password matches (KNSGP2023 for all admins).

Show “Invalid Admin Username” or “Invalid Password” messages.

Protect all admin routes so only logged-in admins can access them.

2. Admin Privileges / Full Access
Admin Should Be Able To:

Students

View all student details in a table.

Add new students.

Edit student details (name, roll number, password).

Delete student records.

Subjects

Add, edit, delete subjects.

Assign subjects to students if needed.

Attendance

Upload CSV or manually add attendance.

Edit or delete attendance records.

Marks

Upload CSV or manually add marks.

Edit or delete marks.

Library

Add new books with book icon.

Edit or delete books.

Track issued/returned books.

Reports

View attendance, marks, and library reports.

Export reports as PDF (optional).

3. Backend Security

Use session or JWT authentication for admin and students.

Protect admin routes:

function adminAuth(req, res, next) {
  if (req.session && req.session.adminLoggedIn) {
    next(); // allow access
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ message: "Unauthorized: Admin login required" });
  }
}

// Example route
app.get('/students', adminAuth, (req, res) => {
  // return student list
});


Protect sensitive operations (add/edit/delete) so only admins can perform them.

4. Frontend Enhancements

Login Page:

Show specific error messages for invalid username or password.

Disable dashboard access until login is successful.

Admin Dashboard:

Display all student details in a table.

Provide buttons: Add, Edit, Delete for students, subjects, marks, attendance, and library.

Include modals/pop-ups for editing/adding data.

Add book icons for library items.

Notifications & Alerts:

For invalid login attempts.

For successful/failed data operations.

5. Recommended Implementation Flow

Login Validation

On login attempt, check username → then password.

Show clear error messages for invalid entries.

Admin Session

Set session/JWT on successful login.

Only allow access to admin panel if session is valid.

Full CRUD

All tables (students, subjects, attendance, marks, library) have fully functional buttons.

Update backend API to handle add/edit/delete operations securely.

Data Display

Admin can see all students, with attendance %, marks, and issued books.

Use tables with search and filter options for easier management.

✅ Outcome:

Students cannot access admin features.

Admin can perform all operations safely.

Invalid logins are clearly handled with messages.

All data (students, subjects, marks, attendance, library) is fully manageable by admin.
